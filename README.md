## Description

Rate-a-date is a full-stack react application that allows users to post date ideas and locations, as well as rating and commenting. There are a huge amount of apps that help people find people to date, so we created an application to help users figure out where to go and what things make good dates. We built this to review locations and activities specifically from the prespective of utilizing them for dates, and how well they fit into a plethora of categories. Some look for fun adventurous locations such as hiking trails whereas others might just be looking for ideas on what good movies are available to watch together online for a long distance date. There's plenty of ideas out there, time to start exploring.
